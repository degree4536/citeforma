- Avid OLX buyer and seller

- Have been approached multiple times by people trying to scam me in many ways.

- MBWAY is an app that allows users to send and receive money from other users, straight to their bank account without long wait times and other bank complications like providing more sensitive data like your IBAN or SWIFT number

- Most scams related to MBWAY and OLX are mostly due to sellers giving sensitive codes or authorizing money transfers without consent due to their inexperience

- For example, let's say that you're trying to sell your old iPhone. The scammer tries to create an MBWAY account with your phone number and asks you to go to an ATM and get the code so they can have access to your MBWAY account and thus your bank account.

How to prevent this scam? Don't have your phone number publicly available and don't give any MBWAY codes that you receive via SMS.
