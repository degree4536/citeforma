I have a Packet Tracer assignment coming up and my professor asked us to design and configure the network for two co-working spaces.

The co-working space features:
- 14 companies, each with its own VLAN
- A local network 10.10.10.0/24

Here are a few requirements:
- We have to use every IP in the 10.10.10.0 network
- Companies will be VLAN 101-114
- Administration/Management will be VLAN 99
- IT closet will be VLAN 100

The assignment is separated into different groups. I'll be giving you each group individually.

Group 1 is focused on the network assignment for each network, including all the VLANs. For this, we have to design a table with the following fields:
- Network
- Network address
- Host interval
- Broadcast address
- Subnet mask
- Default Gateway
- VLAN ID
- VLAN Name

Group 2 is switch/VLAN configuration. We're going to use three 2960 switches.

Here's what we have to do:
- Name them `SL1`, `SL2` and `SL3`
- Configure to use the `enable` password as `class`
- Create a user `Admin` with the password `cisco`
- Configure remote access only allowing two sessions at once (using vty)
- Ensure that access to active network equipment is solely from the native VLAN and the VLAN belonging to the enterprise (IT).
- Configure local authentication method
- Attribute IPs to the Management/Administration VLAN (VLAN 99) and its Default Gateway
- Create VLANs on switch SL1 and use VTP to pass it onto the other switches
- Attribute VLAN ports to switches SL2 and SL3
- Configure Etherchannel between the switches using the non-proprietary protocol (use FastEthernet)
- Configure the interface(s) that connect the Switches to each other, as well as the main Switch to the Router as Trunk allowing the passage VLAN 1 and the VLANs you just created (FastEthernet0/21-24)
- Configure Rapid PVST+
- Configure Port Security

Group 3 is router and network services configuration. For this, we're going to use one 2911 router and a DNS server.

- Configure basic security
- Configure VLAN routing
- Configure DHCP for the necessary VLANs
- Configure DNS Server
- Use a default route as an internet "exit node"
- Configure NAT (overload), allowing all VLANs
- Ensure that the VLANs belonging to clients can't communicate with each other
- Confirm communication between the IT networks on both co-working spaces using a GRE tunnel.

Group 4 focuses on the ISP cluster and configuring the web servers. The ISP cluster is composed of two 2911 routers connected via de interface s0/0/0 between each router on the network 210.165.200.0/30

- Router `ISP1` and the server `www.srv_isp.pt` are connected via the interface g0/0 on the network 40.40.40.0/24
- Company website `www.coworking.pt` is hosted on a server connected to interface g0/0 on `ISP2` with the IP 194.168.209.1/24
- Ensure  there's communication between the two ISPs. Use OSPF routing on the routers `ISP1` and `ISP2`
- Ensure  there's communication between the computers on both co-working spaces and the servers `www.srv_isp.pt` and `www.coworking.pt`
- Ensure the access to `www.srv_isp.pt` is only done via HTTP, HTTPS and ICMP

Group 5 is all about configuring the same thing we did in Group 4, but in Dual Stack. The goal is to have everything implemented and tested in IPv4 and IPv6.

1. Configure and implement all the IPv6 addressing for both co-working spaces, while respecting the rules we set in IPv4.

Use the following table to build the IPv6 topology:
ISP1 - RL | `2001:DB8:ABCD:1000:: /64`
ISP1 – WWW.SRV_ISP.PT | `2001:DB8:CAFÉ:1:: /64`
ISP1 – ISP2 | `2001:DB8:D1A5:1:: /64`
ISP2 – WWW.COWORKING.PT | `2001:DB8:AADF:2:: /64`
ISP2 - RT | `2001:DB8:1234:1000:: /64`

2. Lastly, design another table where we have to specifiy the following for both IPv4 and IPv6:
- Device
- Interface (including VLANs)
- Address
- Subnet Mask
- Default Gateway
